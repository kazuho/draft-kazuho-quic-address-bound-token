1.  Introduction

   Some, if not all of the application protocols that are built on top
   of QUIC [QUIC-TRANSPORT], including HTTP/3 [QUIC-HTTP], require or
   would require clients to establish different connections for each
   server name, even when those server names are hosted by the same
   server.  This restriction introduces several drawbacks:

   o  Address validation is required for each connection establishment
      specifying a different server name, thereby restricting the amount
      of data that a server can initially send.

   o  Each connection would go through the slow-start phase, limiting
      the amount of data that can be sent by a server during the early
      stages of each connection.

   o  It is hard if not impossible to control the distribution of the
      bandwidth among the connections.

   To resolve these issues, this document defines a QUIC transport
   parameter that expands the scope of the token from the server name to
   a union of the server name and the server's address tuple.

   When sending a token, a server would embed an identifier of the
   congestion controller associated to the connection.  Then, when
   accepting a new connection using the advertised token, the server
   associates the new connection to the existing congestion controller
   by using the identifier found in the provided token.  Once the server
   succeeds in associating the new connection to the existing congestion

   controller, it can skip address validation and slow-start phase for
   the new connection, as well as using the congestion controller for
   distributing bandwidth between the old and the new connection.

   Even when there is no existing connection, sharing the tokens between
   different server names raises the chance of the server receiving a
   token that has not yet expired, thereby improving the odds of
   skipping address validation and reusing the information of the path,
   such as the estimated round-trip time or the bandwidth.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The address_bound_token Transport Parameter

   A server sends the "address_bound_token" transport parameter (0xTBD)
   to indicate the client that the token it would send using the
   NEW_TOKEN frame can be used for future connections established
   against the same server name, or for those sharing the same server IP
   address and port number.

   Only the server sends the "address_bound_token" transport parameter.
   The transport parameter does not carry a value; the length of the
   value MUST be set to zero.  An endpoint that receives the transport
   parameter not conforming to these requirements MUST terminate the
   connection with a PROTOCOL_VIOLATION error.

3.  Sharing the Congestion Controller

   When multiple QUIC connections are associated to a single congestion
   controller, how the send window is distributed between the
   connections is up to the sender's discretion.

   However, acknowledgements MUST be sent out no later than as when the
   congestion controller is not consolidated.  The loss recovery logic
   SHOULD operate independently for each connection, while forwarding
   receipts of acknowledgements and loss signals to the consolidated
   congestion controller.

4.1.  Reflection Attack

   An attacker can create a connection to obtain an address-bound token,
   warm up the connection, then initiate a new connection by using the
   token with a spoofed client address or port number.  If the server
   skips address validation and retains the congestion window as-is, the
   spoofed address might receive a fair amount of packet.

   The impact of the attack is equivalent to the spoofed NAT rebinding
   attack.  A server SHOULD NOT skip path validation if the source IP
   address of an initiating connection is different from the address for
   which the address-bound token was issued.

4.2.  Plaintext Tokens

   An address-bound token MUST NOT expose linkability between
   connections, for example by including the identifier of the
   congestion controller in cleartext.  Exposing a value shared between
   multiple connections in the tokens would allow observers to identify
   the connections belonging to the same client.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

              Alternative Services", RFC 7838, DOI 10.17487/RFC7838,
              April 2016, <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7838>.

Appendix A.  Design Variations

A.1.  Using Alt-Svc Name as the Key

   An alternative approach to using the server's address tuple as the
   scope of the token is to use the "host" value of the Alt-Svc
   [RFC7838] header field as the scope.

   In such an approach, a server would send one host value for all the
   origins it hosts.  Then, a client using the value of the host as the
   scope of the tokens would be able to send a token received on any of
   the connections that went to the server on any of the future
   connections that goes to the server.

   The downside of the approach is that the design works only for HTTP/3
   connections being upgraded by the Alt-Svc header field.

A.2.  Cross-connection Prioritization

   A natural extension to the proposed scheme would be to define a way
   of prioritizing the connections, so that some connections can be
   given higher precedence than others.  As an example, it would be
   sensible to prioritize a connection carrying real-time video stream
   above a connection that is transferring an update image of an
   operating system.

   A simple way of prioritizing between the connections would be to
   associate a priority value to every connection that would be
   respected by the sender when it distributes the bandwidth among the
   connections.

   The PRIORITY frame (type=0xTBD) indicates the priority.

    0
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Priority (8) |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Priority field carries the priority of the connection, subtracted
   by one.

   Each connection is assigned a priority value between 1 and 256.  The
   initial priority is 16.

Internet-Draft    Shared Congestion Controller for QUIC       April 2019


   The PRIORITY frame is sent by an endpoint to encourage the receiver
   to assign bandwidth proportional to the suggested priority value for
   each connection.

   The priority value carried by the PRIORITY frame is unidirectional.
   A client advertises its preference on how the data sent by the server
   should be prioritized; a server advertises its preference on how the
   data sent by the client should be prioritized.

Appendix B.  Acknowledgements

   A proposal exists that advocates for having a transport parameter to
   change the scope of a token to a list of server names:

   Sy-preprint-Surfing-the-Web-quicker-than-QUIC-via-a-shared-Address-
   Validation.pdf .  The approach described in this document is
   different from that in the following aspects:

   o  The scope of the token is the union of the server name and the
      server's address tuple.

   o  The token is used also for consolidating the congestion
      controller.
